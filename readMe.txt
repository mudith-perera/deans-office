//Solution for the bug
Something do with the main.js file code parts for not deleting error

// password reset need to fix!!
// conference publication status need to change to indexed or non-indexed
// report date validation
// add user validations, (cannot add more than 1 dean, 6 deptHeads, 2 dept heads to same dept)
